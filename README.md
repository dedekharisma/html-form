# My Front End Journey: HTML Forms

Welcome to the next chapter of <a href="https://github.com/dedekharisma/my-frontend-journey">my front-end development journey</a>! In this section, I'm diving deep into **HTML Forms**â€”one of the most essential parts of any interactive website.

## What You'll Find Here

This part of the series focuses on building and understanding HTML forms. Here's what I aim to cover:

- **Basic Form Elements**: Understanding essential tags like `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and others.
- **Form Attributes**: Exploring attributes like `action`, `method`, `name`, and how they affect form functionality.
- **Input Types**: Working with various input types including `text`, `email`, `password`, `radio`, `checkbox`, `date`, and more.
- **Form Validation**: Learning both basic HTML5 form validation (using attributes like `required`, `pattern`, `min`, and `max`) and an introduction to JavaScript form validation.
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Making sure forms are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by using proper labels and ARIA attributes.

## Why I'm Doing This

I've always been fascinated by the web and how it works. This repository is my way of taking the first steps towards becoming a proficient web developer. By documenting my journey here, I hope to track my progress and maybe even help others who are on a similar path.

Thanks for checking out my work, and happy coding!
